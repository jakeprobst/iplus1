OKAYHERESTHEPLAN




libiplus1 will be a c library that you throw your sentences in and it stems/joins/does magic to it
it`ll also have a function where you throw a sentence into it and it tells you what words are not in the list

like iplus1_collection_add_sentence function that`ll parse out a sentence and store the individual words
then iplus1_collection_get_new_words will output a list of words the sentence contains that are not in the collection


then we`ll have iplus1d
it`ll load up all the sentences at startup and keep them around or something
it`ll sit and listen for connections
someone can send the sentences from their anki deck to the daemon and request X sentences with Y new words in them
iplus1d will then go through the sentence db and send back acceptable sentences


and probably iplus1c as a thing to take the .anki file and query a server and/or do it locally
